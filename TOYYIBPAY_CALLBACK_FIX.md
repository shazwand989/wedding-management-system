# 🚀 ToyyibPay Callback Issue - RESOLVED!

## 🔍 Problem Diagnosis

**Issue**: After successful ToyyibPay payments, bookings still showed "Pay" buttons because the payment callback wasn't processing correctly.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. ✅ ToyyibPay payments were actually successful (confirmed via API)
2. ❌ Callback processing had multiple bugs preventing status updates
3. ❌ Database wasn't being updated after successful payments

## 🛠️ Bugs Fixed in `includes/toyyibpay.php`

### 1. Transaction Lookup Bug
**Problem**: Looking for non-existent `billcode` field in API response
```php
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
foreach ($transactions as $trans) {
    if ($trans['billcode'] === $billCode) { // This field doesn't exist!
        $transaction = $trans;
        break;
    }
}
```

**Fix**: Use first transaction since `getBillTransactions()` already filters by bill code
```php
// AFTER (FIXED):
$transaction = $transactions[0];
$transaction['billcode'] = $billCode; // Add for consistency
```

### 2. Amount Conversion Bug  
**Problem**: Incorrectly dividing amount by 100
```php
// BEFORE (WRONG):
$amount = $transaction['billpaymentAmount'] / 100; // API already returns proper decimals
```

**Fix**: Use amount as-is since ToyyibPay returns proper decimal format
```php
// AFTER (CORRECT):
$amount = (float)$transaction['billpaymentAmount']; // RM 5000.00 stays RM 5000.00
```

### 3. Date Format Bug
**Problem**: ToyyibPay date format incompatible with MySQL
```php
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
$paymentDate = $transaction['billPaymentDate']; // "24-09-2025 02:34:50"
// MySQL expects: "2025-09-24 02:34:50"
```

**Fix**: Convert date format properly
```php
// AFTER (FIXED):
$dateTime = DateTime::createFromFormat('d-m-Y H:i:s', $paymentDateRaw);
$paymentDate = $dateTime ? $dateTime->format('Y-m-d H:i:s') : date('Y-m-d H:i:s');
```

### 4. Transaction ID Field Bug
**Problem**: Using wrong field for transaction ID
```php
// BEFORE (WRONG):
$transactionId = $transaction['billpaymentTransactionId'] ?? ''; // Field doesn't exist
```

**Fix**: Use correct field name
```php
// AFTER (CORRECT):  
$transactionId = $transaction['billpaymentInvoiceNo'] ?? ''; // TP2509240006412673
```

### 5. Booking Status Update Enhancement
**Added**: Automatic booking status update when payment completes
```php
// NEW FEATURE:
booking_status = CASE 
    WHEN booking_status = 'pending' AND paid_amount + ? >= total_amount THEN 'confirmed'
    ELSE booking_status
END
```

## ✅ Test Results

### Before Fix:
- 🔴 Booking #1000: RM 5,000 total, RM 0 paid, status "pending"
- 🔴 ToyyibPay showed payment successful but database wasn't updated
- 🔴 Pay button still visible on customer portal

### After Fix:
- ✅ **Booking #1000**: RM 5,000 total, **RM 5,000 paid**, status **"PAID"** 
- ✅ **Booking status**: Updated to **"CONFIRMED"**
- ✅ **Payment record**: Created with transaction ID TP2509240006412673
- ✅ **Pay button**: **DISAPPEARED** from customer bookings page
- ✅ **ToyyibPay transaction**: Marked as "successful" in database

## 🎯 Solution Verification

### API Response Structure (for reference):
```json
{
    "billpaymentStatus": "1",           // 1 = SUCCESSFUL
    "billpaymentAmount": "5000.00",     // Already in RM format
    "billpaymentInvoiceNo": "TP2509240006412673",
    "billPaymentDate": "24-09-2025 02:34:50",  // dd-mm-yyyy format
    "billExternalReferenceNo": "1000"   // Booking ID
}
```

### Database Updates Applied:
1. **payments table**: New record with RM 5,000 payment
2. **bookings table**: paid_amount = 5000, payment_status = 'paid', booking_status = 'confirmed'  
3. **toyyibpay_transactions table**: status = 'successful', transaction_id = 'TP2509240006412673'

## 🚨 Why Callbacks May Still Fail

Even with these fixes, ToyyibPay callbacks might still fail to reach your server due to:

1. **Network Issues**: ToyyibPay → Your Server connection problems
2. **Firewall Blocking**: Server blocking ToyyibPay's callback requests
3. **SSL Certificate Issues**: Callback URL not accessible via HTTPS
4. **Server Downtime**: Your server temporarily unavailable when callback is sent

## 🛡️ Backup Solutions Implemented

### 1. Manual Payment Sync Tool
- **File**: `debug/payment-sync-fixer.php`
- **Purpose**: Detect and fix payment discrepancies
- **Usage**: Run periodically to sync missed callbacks

### 2. Callback Debug Tool  
- **File**: `debug/callback-debug.php`
- **Purpose**: Test callback URL and diagnose issues
- **Features**: URL accessibility check, callback simulation, log viewing

### 3. Enhanced Error Logging
- All callback attempts logged to system error log
- Detailed transaction processing logs for debugging

## 📋 Monitoring Checklist

### Daily Checks:
- [ ] Review `toyyibpay_transactions` table for pending payments
- [ ] Run payment sync fixer to catch missed callbacks  
- [ ] Check system logs for callback errors

### Weekly Checks:
- [ ] Verify all successful ToyyibPay payments have corresponding database records
- [ ] Monitor for any payment discrepancies
- [ ] Test callback URL accessibility
