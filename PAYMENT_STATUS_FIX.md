# 🔧 Payment Status Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Identified ❌
**Issue**: After successful ToyyibPay payments, the "Pay" button still appears on the customer bookings page because payment status was not being updated correctly.

**Root Cause**: The `createBill()` method in `includes/toyyibpay.php` was not storing local transaction records in the `toyyibpay_transactions` table, making it difficult to track and sync payment statuses.

## Solution Implemented ✅

### 1. Updated ToyyibPay Integration (`includes/toyyibpay.php`)
- **Modified `createBill()` method** to accept PDO connection parameter
- **Added local transaction tracking** - now stores bill records in `toyyibpay_transactions` table
- **Enhanced error handling** and proper database integration

### 2. Updated Payment Processing (`customer/payment.php`)
- **Modified to pass PDO connection** to the `createBill()` method
- **Ensures transaction records** are stored locally when bills are created

### 3. Payment Status Logic (`customer/bookings.php`)
The existing logic correctly checks both conditions:
```php
<?php if ($booking['total_amount'] > $booking['paid_amount'] && $booking['payment_status'] !== 'paid' && $booking['booking_status'] !== 'cancelled'): ?>
    <a href="payment.php?booking_id=<?php echo $booking['id']; ?>" class="btn btn-success btn-sm">
        <i class="fas fa-credit-card"></i> Pay
    </a>
<?php endif; ?>
```

### 4. Callback Processing (`includes/toyyibpay-callback.php`)
- **Race condition prevention** with file locking
- **Proper status updates** for both payments and bookings tables
- **Transaction verification** before updating status

## Debug Tools Created 🛠️

### 1. Payment Sync Fixer (`debug/payment-sync-fixer.php`)
- Detects payment discrepancies between local database and ToyyibPay
- Provides manual sync capabilities
- Comprehensive reporting of payment status issues

### 2. Manual Payment Test (`debug/manual-payment-test.php`)
- **Testing tool** to simulate successful payments
- **Demonstrates the fix** without needing actual ToyyibPay transactions
- **Shows before/after** payment status changes

## How to Test the Fix 🧪

### Option 1: Manual Payment Simulation
1. Open: `https://shazwan-danial.my/wedding-management-system/debug/manual-payment-test.php`
2. Click "Simulate Payment" for any booking with outstanding balance
3. Verify the payment status changes from "pending" to "paid"
4. Check customer bookings page - Pay button should disappear

### Option 2: Real ToyyibPay Test
1. Create a new booking through the customer portal
2. Go through the actual ToyyibPay payment process
3. Complete payment on ToyyibPay sandbox
4. Verify callback updates the payment status
5. Check bookings page for status update

## Key Changes Made 📝

### File: `includes/toyyibpay.php`
```php
// Before: createBill($booking_data, $customer_data)
// After: createBill($booking_data, $customer_data, $pdo)

// Added local transaction storage:
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("INSERT INTO toyyibpay_transactions ...");
```

### File: `customer/payment.php`
```php
// Before: $result = $toyyibpay->createBill($booking_data, $customer_data);
// After: $result = $toyyibpay->createBill($booking_data, $customer_data, $pdo);
```

## Expected Results ✨

### ✅ What Should Work Now:
1. **New payments create local transaction records**
2. **Successful payments update booking status to "paid"**
3. **Pay buttons disappear after successful payment**
4. **Payment status badges show correct status**
5. **Booking status updates from "pending" to "confirmed" when fully paid**

### 🔍 How to Verify:
1. Check `toyyibpay_transactions` table has records after creating bills
2. Verify payment callbacks update both `payments` and `bookings` tables
3. Confirm customer bookings page hides Pay button for paid bookings
4. Test that payment status badges display correctly

## Maintenance Notes 📋

### Regular Monitoring:
- Use `debug/payment-sync-fixer.php` to check for discrepancies
- Monitor `toyyibpay_transactions` table for proper record creation
- Watch for failed callbacks and manual intervention needs

### Database Verification:
```sql
-- Check payment discrepancies
SELECT b.id, b.total_amount, b.paid_amount, b.payment_status, 
       SUM(p.amount) as total_payments
FROM bookings b 
LEFT JOIN payments p ON b.id = p.booking_id AND p.status = 'completed'
WHERE b.payment_status != 'paid' OR b.paid_amount != COALESCE(SUM(p.amount), 0)
GROUP BY b.id;
```

## Success Indicators 🎯
